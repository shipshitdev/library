# Session: 2026-01-21

## Summary

Fixed skill naming inconsistencies across SKILL.md files to use kebab-case convention.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified (10 total)

**skills/ directory:**

| File | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| `skills/component-library/SKILL.md` | `Component Library Standards` | `component-library` |
| `skills/design-consistency-auditor/SKILL.md` | `Design Consistency Auditor` | `design-consistency-auditor` |
| `skills/prompt-engineer/SKILL.md` | `Prompt Engineer` | `prompt-engineer` |
| `skills/copywriter/SKILL.md` | `Copywriter` | `copywriter` |
| `skills/workflow-automation/SKILL.md` | `content-workflow-automation` | `workflow-automation` |

**bundles/ directory:**

| File | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| `bundles/frontend/skills/component-library/SKILL.md` | `Component Library Standards` | `component-library` |

| `bundles/ai-agents/skills/prompt-engineer/SKILL.md` | `Prompt Engineer` | `prompt-engineer` |
| `bundles/infrastructure/skills/workflow-automation/SKILL.md` | `content-workflow-automation` | `workflow-automation` |

## Verification

Ran `grep ^name: **/SKILL.md` to confirm all skill names now use kebab-case.

## Status

Complete - all naming inconsistencies fixed.

## Session 2: Local Plugin Configuration Cleanup

### Summary

Cleaned up `.claude/settings.local.json` to remove unnecessary plugins that don't apply to this skills/plugins library repository.

### Context

This `library` repo contains:

- 124 skills (markdown + JSON)
- 35 commands (markdown)
- 14 bundles
- JS scripts for generation/validation

It is **NOT** an application codebase - no TypeScript app code to refactor or navigate.

### Changes Made

**File Modified:** `.claude/settings.local.json`

**Plugins Removed (4):**

| Plugin | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official` | No TS app code to navigate |
| `code-simplifier@claude-plugins-official` | No app code to refactor |
| `feature-dev@claude-plugins-official` | Overkill for docs/config work |
| `ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official` | No iterative loop use case |

**Plugins Kept (3):**

| Plugin | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `plugin-dev@claude-plugins-official` | Essential for developing/maintaining plugins |
| `session-documenter@shipshitdev` | Documents session work to `.agent/SESSIONS/` |
| `rules-capture@shipshitdev` | Captures coding conventions |

### Before/After

**Before:**

```json
"enabledPlugins": {
  "typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official": true,
  "code-simplifier@claude-plugins-official": true,
  "feature-dev@claude-plugins-official": true,
  "ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official": true,
  "frontend-design@claude-plugins-official": false,
  "plugin-dev@claude-plugins-official": true,
  "session-documenter@shipshitdev": true,
  "rules-capture@shipshitdev": true
}
```

**After:**

```json
"enabledPlugins": {
  "plugin-dev@claude-plugins-official": true,
  "session-documenter@shipshitdev": true,
  "rules-capture@shipshitdev": true
}
```

### Status

Complete - plugin configuration cleaned up. Restart session and run `/plugins` to verify.

## Session 3: README Skills Table Update

### Summary

Updated README.md to include all 124 skills with a new 3-column table format including links to skills.sh and individual install commands.

### Problem

- README listed only 50 skills but 124 exist in `skills/` directory
- Skills table had no links to skills.sh
- No individual install commands per skill

### Changes Made

**File Modified:** `README.md`

| Location | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Line 13 | `# All skills (123 skills)` | `# All skills (124 skills)` |
| Lines 136-187 | 2-column table (50 skills) | 3-column table (124 skills) |

**New Table Format:**

```markdown
| Skill | Description | Install |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| [accessibility](https://skills.sh/shipshitdev/library/accessibility) | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | `npx skills add shipshitdev/library --skill accessibility` |
```

### Verification

- Counted 124 `skills.sh/shipshitdev/library` links in README
- Matches directory count: `ls skills/ | wc -l` = 124
- Spot-checked first and last entries for correct format

## Session 3b: Symlink Cleanup

### Summary

Removed looping symlinks in `.claude/` directory that were pointing back to global config.

### Problem

Found symlinks creating circular references:

```
.claude/agents/agents -> /Users/decod3rs/.claude/agents
.claude/rules/rules   -> /Users/decod3rs/.claude/rules
```

These were untracked in git and likely created accidentally.

### Changes Made

**Files Deleted:**

- `.claude/agents/agents` (symlink)
- `.claude/rules/rules` (symlink)

### Status

Complete - looping symlinks removed.
