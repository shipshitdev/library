## Session 1: Create skill-capture Skill

### Summary

Created new `skill-capture` skill that extracts valuable learnings, patterns, and workflows from conversations and persists them as reusable skill files.

### Context

This skill complements the existing `rules-capture` skill:

- `rules-capture` → Captures user preferences/rules to docs
- `skill-capture` → Captures workflows/patterns to SKILL.md files

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `skills/skill-capture/SKILL.md` | Main skill documentation (7.7KB) |
| `skills/skill-capture/plugin.json` | Plugin metadata |

### SKILL.md Structure

```
skills/skill-capture/
├── SKILL.md          # Main documentation
└── plugin.json       # Metadata
```

### Key Features Implemented

**Activation Triggers:**

- Explicit requests ("save this as a skill", "capture this pattern")
- Workflow completion signals (complex problem solved, multi-step procedure executed)
- Learning moments ("this was tricky", "glad we got this working")

**5-Phase Capture Process:**

1. **Identification** - Review conversation for capturable content
2. **Destination Planning** - Check existing skills, determine if new or update
3. **Content Drafting** - Transform insights into SKILL.md format
4. **Distillation** - Extract working approach, generalize, add context
5. **Verification** - Quality checks (length, frontmatter, actionability)

**Differentiation Table:**

| rules-capture | skill-capture |
|---------------|---------------|
| Preferences/rules | Workflows/patterns/learnings |
| Outputs to CAPTURED-RULES.md | Creates/updates SKILL.md files |
| "always/never do X" triggers | "save this as skill" triggers |
| Single statements | Multi-step procedures |

### Integration

Works with:

- `rules-capture` - Delegates preference capture
- `session-documenter` - Skills captured during session are noted
- `skill-creator` - Uses creation patterns and validation
- `docs` - For formatting help

### Status

Complete - skill ready for use.
