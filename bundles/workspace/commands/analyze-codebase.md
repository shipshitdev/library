# Analyze Codebase - Comprehensive Analysis

Deep analysis of codebase structure, patterns, and quality.

## When to Use

- Understanding a new codebase
- Architecture review
- Technical debt assessment
- Before major refactoring
- Onboarding to a project

## Analysis Areas

### 1. Structure Analysis

Examine project layout:
- Directory structure
- File organization
- Module boundaries
- Package dependencies

### 2. Pattern Analysis

Identify coding patterns:
- Architectural patterns used
- Common abstractions
- Naming conventions
- Error handling patterns

### 3. Quality Analysis

Assess code quality:
- Type safety (any types count)
- Test coverage
- Code complexity
- Documentation coverage

### 4. Dependency Analysis

Review dependencies:
- External packages
- Internal dependencies
- Circular dependencies
- Outdated packages

### 5. Technical Debt

Identify debt areas:
- TODOs and FIXMEs
- Deprecated patterns
- Inconsistencies
- Missing tests

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: High-Level Overview

Get project structure:
- List top-level directories
- Identify main entry points
- Understand build setup

### Step 2: Core Components

Identify key parts:
- Main modules/services
- Shared utilities
- Configuration
- Tests

### Step 3: Pattern Discovery

Find established patterns:
- Search for common abstractions
- Identify service patterns
- Note component structures

### Step 4: Quality Metrics

Gather metrics:
- Count any types
- Check test files
- Review error handling
- Assess documentation

### Step 5: Report Findings

Summarize:
- Architecture overview
- Key patterns found
- Quality observations
- Recommended improvements

## Output Format

Provide structured analysis:
1. Project Overview
2. Directory Structure
3. Key Patterns
4. Quality Assessment
5. Recommendations
