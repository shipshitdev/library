## Session 1: SKILL.md File Splitting (Continued)

**Duration:** Continuation of previous session
**Focus:** Splitting large SKILL.md files and replacing docusaurus-writer

### Tasks Completed

1. **Split content-creator** (408 → 86 lines)
   - Created concise SKILL.md with content types, voice discovery checklist, structure tables
   - Moved detailed workflows, examples, content lineup generation to `references/full-guide.md`

2. **Split scale-validator** (407 → 92 lines)
   - Created concise SKILL.md with Hormozi 10x stress test framework overview
   - Moved detailed scoring criteria, assessment templates, scale roadmaps to `references/full-guide.md`

3. **Split cto-advisor** (404 → 105 lines)
   - Created concise SKILL.md with quick start, core responsibilities, key ratios, DORA metrics
   - Moved operational cadences, crisis management, communication templates to `references/full-guide.md`
   - Preserved existing references (architecture_decision_records.md, engineering_metrics.md, technology_evaluation_framework.md)

4. **Replaced docusaurus-writer with nextra-writer**
   - Created new `nextra-writer` skill for Next.js-based documentation
   - SKILL.md with tech stack, project structure, navigation config, key features
   - `references/full-guide.md` with complete Nextra configuration, MDX patterns, built-in components, API documentation patterns, migration guide from Docusaurus
   - Removed old `docusaurus-writer` folder

### Files Created

- `/agents/.claude/skills/content-creator/SKILL.md` (rewritten, 86 lines)
- `/agents/.claude/skills/content-creator/references/full-guide.md`
- `/agents/.claude/skills/scale-validator/SKILL.md` (rewritten, 92 lines)
- `/agents/.claude/skills/scale-validator/references/full-guide.md`
- `/agents/.claude/skills/cto-advisor/SKILL.md` (rewritten, 105 lines)
- `/agents/.claude/skills/cto-advisor/references/full-guide.md`
- `/agents/.claude/skills/nextra-writer/SKILL.md` (new, 100 lines)
- `/agents/.claude/skills/nextra-writer/references/full-guide.md` (new)

### Files Deleted

- `/agents/.claude/skills/docusaurus-writer/` (entire folder)

### Patterns Established

- **SKILL.md splitting pattern:** Concise main file (~90-105 lines) with:
  - Frontmatter (name, description, version, tags)
  - When This Activates triggers
  - Quick Reference tables
  - Integration section with related skills
  - Link to `references/full-guide.md`

- **Full guide contains:** Detailed scoring criteria, step-by-step workflows, output templates, examples

### Total Session Stats (Combined)

- 22 skills split (from 400-732 lines down to ~90-105 lines each)
- 1 skill replaced (docusaurus → nextra)

### Next Steps

- Run `/clear` to clear conversation context
- Consider reviewing any remaining skills above 400 lines for splitting
