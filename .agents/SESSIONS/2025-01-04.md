## Session 1 (7:30 PM)

### Goal

Import high-quality Claude Code skills from external repositories into the AgenticIndieDev library, syncing across all three platforms (Claude, Codex, Cursor).

### Changes Made

#### Repositories Reviewed

1. **rohunvora/my-claude-skills** - Context engineering suite (9 skills imported)
2. **rohunvora/cool-claude-skills** - UX/workflow skills (6 skills imported)
3. **anthropics/skills** - Official Anthropic skills (2 skills imported)
4. **alirezarezvani/claude-skills** - 42 role-based skills (1 skill imported)
5. **travisvn/awesome-claude-skills** - Curated links only (skipped)
6. **simonw/claude-skills** - Redirects to Anthropic (skipped)

#### Skills Imported (18 total)

**From rohunvora/my-claude-skills (Context Engineering):**

- `context-fundamentals` - Core agent system concepts, attention mechanics
- `context-optimization` - Compaction, masking, KV-cache optimization
- `context-degradation` - Failure patterns and mitigation
- `memory-systems` - Working/short/long-term/temporal memory architectures
- `multi-agent-patterns` - Supervisor, peer-to-peer, hierarchical designs
- `tool-design` - Tool API design, consolidation principle
- `evaluation` - Performance testing frameworks
- `advanced-evaluation` - LLM-as-Judge, bias mitigation
- `spec-first` - spec.md -> todo.md -> execute -> verify workflow

**From rohunvora/cool-claude-skills (UX/Workflow):**

- `quick-view` - Terminal output to browsable HTML
- `incremental-fetch` - Two-watermark API ingestion with resume
- `ai-loading-ux` - Loading states, streaming, progress indicators
- `comment-mode` - Inline HTML comments on drafts
- `table-filters` - Smart filter type selection for tables
- `html-style` - CSS styling system for quick-view

**From anthropics/skills (Official):**

- `theme-factory` - 10 preset themes for artifacts
- `frontend-design` - Anti-AI-slop design philosophy

**From alirezarezvani/claude-skills (Leadership):**

- `cto-advisor` - Tech leadership, DORA metrics, team scaling

#### Files Modified

- `agents/.claude/skills/` - Added 18 new skill directories
- `agents/.codex/skills/` - Synced 18 new skill directories
- `agents/.cursor/skills/` - Synced 18 new skill directories

### Decisions

- Prioritized context engineering skills as they fill a gap in foundational AI agent development knowledge
- Skipped templated/generic role skills from alirezarezvani except cto-advisor which had substantive content
- Skipped UX-specific skills (fix-hierarchy, fix-spacing, etc.) that were too narrow
- Skipped messaging ingest skills (imsg-ingest, tg-ingest) that were too personal/niche

### Final Library Count

| Platform | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| Claude | 99 |
| Codex | 97 |
| Cursor | 97 |

### Incomplete

- Changes not committed to git (user preference to review before commit)
- Previous untracked directories still pending: `playwright-e2e-init/`, `testing-cicd-init/`
